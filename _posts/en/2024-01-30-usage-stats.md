What are usage statistics?
Essentially, it involves processing information from user interactions across various scientific document search portals, both at the repository level, national Node level, and on the LA Referencia website. Our workflow consists of three stages:

- **Data Collection**
- **Processing**
- **Building Statistical Visualizations**

## **Data Collection**

In this stage, we gather data using DSpace stats collector, Vufind, and Vufind with Matomo. Data collection occurs at the repository, national Node, and LA Referencia levels. This "raw" information needs to undergo a filtering and normalization process.

## **Data Processing**
We store the data in Amazon S3 in Parquet format with partitions, enabling granular and efficient querying. This data is filtered and normalized through a pipeline architecture to eliminate redundant data and data from events generated by robots.
