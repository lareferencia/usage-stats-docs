<p class="lead-highlight">The advancement of Open Science largely depends on the development of standardized metrics that can measure the usage and impact of research across different communities and platforms.</p>

## The Need for Better Research Metrics

Traditionally, indicators like citations and journal impact factors have been used for this purpose, but they are insufficient to capture the full spectrum of how research outcomes are utilized by society.

  <div class="note-header">
    <h4>Why Traditional Metrics Fall Short</h4>
  </div>
  <div class="note-content">
    <p>Citation metrics only capture formal academic impact, missing:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Downloads from diverse user communities</li>
      <li>Usage patterns across different regions</li>
      <li>Other applications outside academia</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

## About LA Referencia

LA Referencia, as a key player in the academic community of Latin America, has led efforts to introduce common usage statistics that complement existing metrics. This project aims to provide a more comprehensive view of how research outputs are used, both by the scientific community and the general public. Through the development of a robust usage statistics service, LA Referencia is moving toward a deeper understanding and increased visibility of the impact of open research.

## Recent Advancements
