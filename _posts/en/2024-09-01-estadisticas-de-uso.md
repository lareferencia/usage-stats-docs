The advancement of Open Science largely depends on the development of standardized metrics that can measure the usage and impact of research. Traditionally, indicators like citations and journal impact factors have been used for this purpose, but they are insufficient to capture the full spectrum of how research outcomes are utilized by society.

LA Referencia, as a key player in the academic community of Latin America, has led efforts to introduce common usage statistics that complement existing metrics. This project aims to provide a more comprehensive view of how research outputs are used, both by the scientific community and the general public. Through the development of a robust usage statistics service, LA Referencia is moving toward a deeper understanding and increased visibility of the impact of open research.

During the 2023/2024 cycle, the LA Referencia Usage Statistics project, with funding support from SCOSS, underwent significant advancements. It migrated to a more flexible and scalable architecture, improving the system's reliability and enabling the integration of new tools. Key achievements include the implementation of more efficient event tracking, optimization of data storage through solutions like Amazon S3, and improvements in bot detection to ensure metric accuracy. Additionally, an advanced identifier normalization system was introduced, and custom widgets were developed for repositories, facilitating greater interaction and analysis of usage data. These advancements enhance LA Referencia's ability to provide a more accurate and detailed view of research usage in the region.
