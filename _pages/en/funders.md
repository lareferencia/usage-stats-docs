The usage statistics project is part of the ongoing development of LA Referencia's team, which is sustained by the contributions of its member countries across Latin America and Spain. Thanks to the collaboration and commitment of these nations, LA Referencia continues to strengthen and expand its services in support of open science.

During the 2023-2024 cycle, the development of our usage statistics system has been made possible by the contributions received through the Global Sustainability Coalition for Open Science Services (SCOSS). SCOSS is an international coalition established in 2017, which identifies and supports essential infrastructure for open science, specifically non-commercial services that require stronger financial backing. Through a collaborative funding model, SCOSS enables institutions worldwide to directly invest in the sustainability of these critical infrastructures, ensuring their long-term viability and growth.
